Hi there, I'm haved.
I enjoy programming, and my current endeavor is writing the compiler for my own programming language, daf.
I'm still in school, and no one pays me to write code, so it's purely a labor of love. (I wouldn't expect anyone to pay for this compiler)
I've been going at it for just over two years as of writing this, 2017-01-10, changed implementation language once, and written/re-written a lot of bad code.
The current version can just about compile a file with some functions and an if statement, but good luck getting anything done with the operators available.
The type system only has void, primitives and functions, and the language is designed around clojures, without which it feels a bit bland.
  
Oh, and I was at the IOI 2017.
